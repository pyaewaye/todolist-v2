# To Do List App
This is a To Do List app to maintain your day-to-day tasks. Other than the main to-do page, you can also create custom to-do pages simply by appending /YourCustomListName in the url. Fill in the task and click + button to add, check it out to remove. For every new page, suggested 3 default tasks for you!
